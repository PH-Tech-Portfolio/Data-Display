# Data-Display

Followed 2 tutorials to learn some asp net. 

1. https://youtu.be/hZ1DASYd9rk

^^^ Both up to date great tutorials. I highly reccomend!

## What I did?
One was a intro kinda course. The other was a db first asp net YT video. I took the information I learned after watching (A FEW) times, following along, and then creating my own unique version how I wanted :-)

## What is Happening?
I have a Docker container running from class. I downloaded a csv file with data from [Alberta Stats](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm?aff_id=1262#data-export). I then used a method showed in class to import a flat file into MS Server Manager. Then with the data I was able to use MS Entity Framework to scaffold the db for me in the code using a command found in first YT video. After this point I used what I learned from the first video tutorial to create a simple page and display the data in a table using C#.

Note: I am like 95% sure that I have to have docker running on local machine bc when I connected with connection string I am trusting local cirt and also providing the local loopback for the server. So ig that is more like 99% sure but anyway, docker has to be on local sys, running...
