Followed 2 tutorials to learn some asp net. 

1. https://youtu.be/hZ1DASYd9rk
1. https://youtu.be/2bsRQIhtTxs

^^^ Both up to date great tutorials. I highly reccomend!

## Included samples of (exposure to):
* Entity Framework
* SQL
* SSMS (Sql Server Management Studio (Microsoft))
* C#
* Asp.Net
* MCV (Model View Controller)
* HTML && CSS
* Bootstrap && Bootswatch
* Docker

## What I did?
One was a intro kinda course. The other was a db first asp net YT video. I took the information I learned after watching (A FEW) times, following along, and then creating my own unique version how I wanted :-)

## What is Happening?
I have a Docker container running from class. I downloaded a csv file with data from [Alberta Stats](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm?aff_id=1262#data-export). I then used a method showed in class to import a flat file into MS Server Manager. Then with the data I was able to use MS Entity Framework to scaffold the db for me in the code using a command found in first YT video. After this point I used what I learned from the first video tutorial to create a simple page and display the data in a table using C#. For some of the styles + icons I am using Bootstrap. The theme is a Bootswatch theme you can find [here](https://bootswatch.com/morph/).

Note: I am like 95% sure that I have to have docker running on local machine bc when I connected with connection string I am trusting local cirt and also providing the local loopback for the server. So ig that is more like 99% sure but anyway, docker has to be on local sys, running...

^^^Only showing ~100 records in table. There is like 60k but I have to work on a way to go through em. 
Currently working on calling non iaction methods on a button click. Not sure if that makes sence but am looking into it and will update!


Will add more later. Videos took a bit to go through but was able to create this in morning...
